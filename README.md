### Diving Deep into AI and Engineering: Welcome to my Github :wave:  
<hr></hr>

   As an Engineer and AI enthusiast, I'm passionate about developing projects that not only expand my skills, but also have real-world applications. That's why I've curated a selection of 6 projects, spanning 4 different programming languages (Python, Java, C++, JS) and covering topics such as Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Engineering, and Full Stack Development.

 Whether I'm tackling fraud detection, customer churn analysis, brake validation for racing vehicles, or building a full-stack food delivery app, my projects are designed to challenge me and keep me on the cutting edge of technology. And with a commitment to thorough documentation, you can be sure that each project showcases my technical abilities and attention to detail.

 I encourage you to explore my projects and see for yourself what I've been up to. Who knows? You might find something that sparks your own interest, or even inspires you to embark on a new project. So don't be shy â€“ take a look, get in touch, and let's make some magic happen! :rocket: :rocket:
